This repository includes all the code I created and extended for my Mathematics Computing Lab research project Spring Semester 2020 under Professor Evangelos Kobotis.

The following programs were extended:

Hyperbolic Space, Hyperbolic Space Example, Tessellation, Tori,

All other programs are entirely original.
